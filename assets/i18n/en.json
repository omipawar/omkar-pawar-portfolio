    "INTRO": "I am a passionate MEAN stack developer with over 3.6 years of experience, with a strong emphasis on front-end development using Angular (60–70%) and solid hands-on experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (30–40%) on the backend.\n\nI specialize in building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that solve real-world problems. My focus is on delivering clean, maintainable code and crafting seamless user experiences powered by Angular's robust framework and component-driven architecture.\n\nOn the backend, I design and integrate RESTful APIs, manage databases, and ensure smooth communication between services, contributing to scalable and performant full-stack solutions.\n\nI’m driven by a love for learning and continuously exploring new technologies to stay ahead in the evolving web development landscape.",
